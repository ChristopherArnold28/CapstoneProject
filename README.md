# CapstoneProject
This repository contains all the files for the Coursera Data Science Capstone project

The only files not included are the raw text files used to build the training data. These files were too large to include in this repository

#Files
- Capstone.R
  This is the script file to work on all the parts of the project locally before commiting them into a report format or into the application
 - NGramModel.R
   Similar to capstone.R where this file was used locally to build and test the model before moving it into the application. The performance computing is also done in this file
   
 - Presentation.md
 - WordGram1 - WordGram6.RdData
    These are copies of the files the application consumes to use for the model to predict words
 - MilestoneReport.md
